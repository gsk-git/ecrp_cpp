In C++, there are **many ways** to declare variables, and each serves a **different purpose or behavior**. Let’s walk through them **step-by-step**, in **human-level explanations**, with **realistic use cases**.

---

## 🔹 1. **Basic Variable Declaration**

```cpp
int health = 100;
```

* Simple and most common way.
* Declares a variable named `health` of type `int` and assigns `100`.
* Stored in stack memory (usually).

---

## 🔹 2. **Uninitialized Declaration**

```cpp
int score;
```

* Declares the variable, but **doesn’t initialize** it.
* ⚠️ Dangerous — it contains **garbage value** until assigned.
* Only use if you're **sure** you’ll assign it later before using it.

---

## 🔹 3. **Const (Immutable Variable)**

```cpp
const int maxLives = 3;
```

* Can be assigned **only once**.
* Compiler ensures you **never change it**.
* Use for **safety**, to avoid accidental overwrites.

---

## 🔹 4. **constexpr (Compile-time constant)**

```cpp
constexpr float pi = 3.14159f;
```

* Like `const`, but must be **known at compile time**.
* Enables compiler **optimizations**.
* Use for things like math constants, screen size, etc.

---

## 🔹 5. **auto (Type Deduction)**

```cpp
auto name = std::string("Player1");
```

* Compiler **figures out** the type based on what you assign.
* Cleaner, safer, especially with long types like iterators or lambdas.

---

## 🔹 6. **Reference**

```cpp
int a = 10;
int& b = a;
```

* `b` is a **reference** to `a`. Changing `b` changes `a`.
* Useful when passing variables to functions **without copying**.

---

## 🔹 7. **Pointer**

```cpp
int* ptr = &a;
```

* Stores the **address** of another variable.
* Use `*ptr` to **access** or **modify** the value at the address.
* Required when working with **dynamic memory**, **arrays**, or **low-level APIs**.

---

## 🔹 8. **Static Variable**

```cpp
void example() {
    static int counter = 0;
    counter++;
    std::cout << counter << "\n";
}
```

* Retains its value **between function calls**.
* Only initialized **once**, even if function is called multiple times.

---

## 🔹 9. **Extern (Global Variable Access Across Files)**

### In `config.h`:

```cpp
extern int screenWidth;
```

### In `config.cpp`:

```cpp
int screenWidth = 1280;
```

* `extern` tells the compiler: “This variable **exists somewhere else**.”
* Used to share globals **across multiple files** without duplication.

---

## 🔹 10. **#define (Macro / Preprocessor)**

```cpp
#define MAX_HEALTH 100
```

* Replaced at **preprocessing stage** (before compilation).
* ⚠️ Not type-safe. Use only for **simple constants or flags**.

---

## 🔹 11. **Enum / Enum Class (Named Set of Constants)**

```cpp
enum Direction { Up, Down, Left, Right };

enum class State { Idle, Walking, Jumping };
```

* Enum: Group of related constants.
* `enum class` is **type-safe** (recommended).

---

## 🔹 12. **Struct/Class Member Variable**

```cpp
struct Player {
    int health = 100;
    std::string name = "Hero";
};
```

* Variables **inside classes or structs**.
* Can be accessed using `.`, e.g., `player.health`.

---

## 🔹 13. **Dynamic Allocation (Heap)**

```cpp
int* health = new int(100);
// ...
delete health;
```

* Manually allocates memory on **heap**.
* Must `delete` it to avoid memory leak.
* Prefer **smart pointers** (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`) in modern C++.

| Keyword      | Purpose                            | Memory       | Safe?                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| `int a = 5;` | Regular variable                   | Stack        | ✅ Yes                  |
| `const`      | Read-only                          | Stack        | ✅ Yes                  |
| `constexpr`  | Compile-time constant              | Stack/inline | ✅ Yes                  |
| `auto`       | Type deduced by compiler           | Stack        | ✅ Yes                  |
| `static`     | Persists across function calls     | Static       | ✅ Yes                  |
| `extern`     | Declare variable from another file | Global       | ✅ Yes                  |
| `#define`    | Preprocessor macro                 | N/A          | ❌ No                   |
| `new`        | Dynamic memory allocation          | Heap         | ❌ Manual delete needed |

## 🧠 Tip to Learn Better

Try creating a **variable of each type** in a small project. Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

constexpr int screenWidth = 1280;
const int screenHeight = 720;
int score = 0;
auto name = std::string("Player");
static int counter = 0;
int* heapVar = new int(100);

std::cout << *heapVar << "\n";
delete heapVar;
```
