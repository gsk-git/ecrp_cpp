    "The year is 2342. Humanity's ambitious deep-space colonization effort, the 'Odyssey Prime' colony ship, has\n",
    "vanished without a trace after entering the Kepler-186f equivalent, now designated 'Xylos-7'. Weeks of\n",
    "silence were broken by a faint, heavily encrypted beacon signal emanating from the planet's surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are Commander [Your Name], assigned to the lead exploratory drone unit 'Pathfinder-1'. Your mission:\n",
    "to navigate Xylos-7's notoriously treacherous and dynamic terrain, reach the anomalous Beacon Source,\n",
    "and retrieve its encrypted data before the planet's hostile environment claims the only remaining clue\n",
    "to the Odyssey Prime's fate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Xylos-7 is a world of extremes: vast, impassable ocean abysses, volatile volcanic craters, treacherous\n",
    "rocky formations, and atmospheric anomalies like dense fogs and disruptive magnetic fields. Even seemingly\n",
    "solid ground can be unstable or infused with corrosive elements. Your drone must meticulously analyze\n",
    "each grid sector, identifying traversal costs and impassable hazards, to forge a path through the\n",
    "uncharted dangers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The future of the Odyssey Prime, and potentially humanity's expansion, rests on your ability to master\n",
    "this alien landscape.\n",
